## About

Emerald Console is a tool to access blockchain(s) from the command line. It connects to an 
external node (_"upstream"_) and allows a user or application to read information from the blockchain and to send new 
transactions. In the latter case it provides functionality to sign transactions by a provided Private Key. The tool 
integrates [emerald-rs](https://github.com/ETCDEVTeam/emerald-rs) with the intention of generation, import, and/or 
storing of Private Keys.

# Moved to `emerald-rs` repo
